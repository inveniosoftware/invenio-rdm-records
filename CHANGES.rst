- deposit-ui: fix affiliation selection input display


Version v16.6.1 (released 2025-01-16)

- Revert "bug: add custom comment notification for record/draft requests"
    * This is actually a breaking change since it introduces a new
      set of notification templates that will potentialy not be
      styled if overridden in an instance's overlay.

Version v16.6.0 (released 2025-01-16)

- notifications: add custom comment template for record inclusion
  and draft review requests

- serializers/bibtex: year and month using publication date
- rights: fix serialize condition for controlled license

Version v16.5.1 (released 2024-12-16)

- pids: add manage permission to be able to manage DOIs
- deposit: fix validation check when user needs a DOI and DOI is optional

Version v16.5.0 (released 2024-12-16)

- pids: add support for optional DOI

Version v16.4.1 (released 2024-12-11)

- mappings: add missing `identifiers` to community orgs
    * Adds the missing `identifiers` mapping field to community organizations

Version v16.4.0 (released 2024-12-10)

- bibtex: add trailing comma in url field
- community-records: allow scan search
    * Adds `scan` and `scan_params` arguments to
      `CommunityRecordsService.search(...)`, to allow for serving scan
      results (but only via the service).
- serializer: updated subjects and affiliations in dcat
- schema: added identifiers to subjects
- serializers: add datapackage serializer (#1742)

Version v16.3.4 (released 2024-12-06)

- github: return None for `NOASSERTION` license
- datacite: fix funding serialization for optional award fields
    * Makes sure that we handle missing values for optional award fields
      like "title" and "number".

Version v16.3.3 (released 2024-12-04)

- github: handle missing repo license

Version v16.3.2 (released 2024-12-04)

- github: lower license spdx id

Version v16.3.1 (released 2024-12-02)

- deposit-ui: make sure we handle null/undefined for SchemaField
- deposit-ui: skip unecessary removal of empty values in serialization
    * This initial removal of empty values can be dangerous, since the
      `record` at this point is a UI object representation that could
      potentially include circular references or very deeply nested objects.
      Since `_removeEmptyValues` is recursive this can lead to stack
      overflow errors.
- deposit-ui: log errors on all deposit form actions
    * This can help with debugging unexpected non-network related errors
      that might occur in the logic before/after a REST API requests.

Version v16.3.0 (released 2024-11-27)

- github: added default license from Github API
- deposit-ui: fix affiliations rendering during edits
- github: added custom_fields in metadata extraction
- github: added optional swhid field to the bibtex export
- datacite: improve error logging formatting and grouping
    * Avoids f-strings in logging calls so that entries are easier to be
      grouped.
    * Adds exception info to the logged errors.
- config: added service schema from config
- requests: manage sending notifications

Version v16.2.0 (released 2024-11-19)

- search: pass search parameters to collection records

Version v16.1.1 (released 2024-11-19)

- communities: fix set/unset of default record community
    * Closes https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-app-rdm/issues/2869
    * Fixes the allowed values that can be passed to set/unset the default
      community of a record.
    * Part of the fix is to also accept an empty string ("") as a valid
      value when setting the "default" field, which was a currently wrong
      behavior in some UI logic.

Version v16.1.0 (released 2024-11-18)

- tokens: disable "sub" verification
    * According to the JWT Specification (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.2)
      `sub` has to be a string. PyJWT v2.10.0 started enforcing this validation,
      which breaks our usage of storing an object in the `sub` field.
    * Fixes jwt.decode options for specifying required fields.
- jsonschemas: backport "internal_notes" to v6.0.0
    * Backports the "internal_notes" field to the v6.0.0 JSONSchema, since
      it is backwards compatible, and thus doesn't require any record
      migration overhead.
- UI: display all affiliations

Version v16.0.1 (released 2024-11-11)

- deposit-ui: fix creator affiliations selection display
    * Fixes a bug where the selected affiliations from the dropdown do not
      appear inside the input box.

Version v16.0.0 (released 2024-11-11)

- identifiers: allow alternative identifiers with the same scheme but different values

- tests: fix EDTF interval with unknown start/end
- ui: use config instead of hardcoded url
- setup: forward compatibility to itsdangerous>=2.1
- fix: DeprecationWarning of SQLAlchemy

Version v15.7.0 (released 2024-11-04)

- resources: make record error handlers configurable
    * Possible via the new `RDM_RECORDS_ERROR_HANDLERS` config variable.
- components: make content moderation configurable
    * Closes #1861.
    * Adds a new `RRM_CONTENT_MODERATION_HANDLERS` config variable to allow
      for configuring multiple handlers for the different write actions.
- user_moderation: use search for faster actions
    * Use search results to determine the user's list of records.
    * Use a TaskOp and Unit of Work to avoid sending Celery tasks immediately.
    * Add a cleanup task that will perform a more thorough check using the
      DB to lookup the user's records.
- deposit: add missing fields to record deserializer
- UI/UX: add consistent suggestions display to affiliations
- UI/UX: improve display of ROR information
- collections: move records search into service

- record inclusion: use system identity to accept inclusion request when can_include_directly
- user_moderation: improve DB queries and use Celery tasks
- fix: use index to distinguish type of record in results
    * The problem with "is_published" is that drafts created from records will
      not be recognised correctly.
    * Using the index is a valid solution but it is not a nice implementation.
- results: added support for drafts in the results list
- fix(community): set branding
    * The set branding didn't work at all. It didn't work for rebranding if
      a default already exists and it didn't work if no branding exists at
      all.
    * The default property of the CommunitiesRelationManager needs a string.
      It can't handle a dict.

Version v11.5.0 (released 2024-07-22)

Version 11.3.0 (released 2024-07-12)

* media-files: generate ptif and include in manifets
* fix: pids required behavior
    * The fix for the parent doi configuration
      https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-rdm-records/pull/1740 broke
      the "required" parameter for the pid provider. Previously you could
      have a pid provider that was active (shows up in the deposit form),
      but not required (pid would only be minted if something was entered).
      Because the check for "required" was removed, this stopped working.
    * This correction enables the option of having external DOIs without
      necessarily having to set one of them. This would not be possible with
      the "is_enabled" configuration.
* iiif: handle DecompressionBombError

- iiif: added proxy to image server

Version 10.1.2 (released 2024-04-22)

- review: fix draft indexing operations order
    - Fixes a bug where when publishing directly to a community (e.g.
      beacause the uploader is a community admin/owner/curator), the draft
      would get deleted from the index and then get indexed again, thus
      appearing in the users' dashboard both as a published record and
